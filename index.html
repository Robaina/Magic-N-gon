      <p id="what-to-do"></p>

      <p>To fill in the numbers, click or touch a circle and edit the value. You can press the <em>Solve!</em> button at any time to solve the game. You can change the polygon from a square to a hexagon by pressing the corresponding buttons. To reset the game, just press the button corresponding to the current n-Gon.</p>


      <h2 style="text-align: center;">What is this?</h2>

      <p>A while ago, I got intrigued by one of the mathematical puzzles proposed by the Plus Magazine &mdash; an online magazine about math &mdash; it was called <a href="https://plus.maths.org/content/magic-19">Magic 19</a>. The puzzle consisted of allocating numbers from 1 to 19 to each of the 19 vertices of a graph with a hexagonal shape, such that each triad of vertices on the same edge had to add up to 22. To be honest, I was not intrigued by the puzzled itself, but by a reader's comment which said that this problem made an excellent case to be solved by linear programming.</p>

      <p>Here, I transform Magic 19 into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming">Integer Linear Program</a> (ILP) &mdash; similarly to what I did to build a <a href="https://robaina.github.io/Sudoku">Sudoku solver</a>. An ILP optimizes a linear objective function over a feasible domain, which is defined by a set of linear constraints, plus the addition that all variables must have integer values. Then, solving the puzzle is a matter of finding a feasible solution to the ILP.</p>

      <p>Each node $i \in \{1, \dots, 3n + 1\}$ in the graph above has $3n + 1$ binary variables assigned: $x_{ij} \;\,\forall j \in {1,\dots,3n + 1}$, where $n$ is the number of vertices of the chosen polygon (i.e. $n=6$ in Magic-19). These variables represent all possible values that a node can have, i.e., all the numbers from 1 to $3n+1$. For instance, if node $i$ has a value of 1, then $x_{11} = 1$. After defining the binary variables, it isn't hard to define an ILP whose solution will be a solution to our puzzle:</p>

      <div id="ilp">
        <p>
          $\max\limits_{x \in \{0, 1\}} \; 0$ <br>
          s.t. <br>
          <br>
          $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{3n+1} x_{ij} = 1 \;\; \,\forall j \in \{1, \dots, 3n + 1\} \;\; (1)$ <br>
          $\sum\limits_{j=1}^{3n+1} x_{ij} = 1 \;\; \,\forall i \in \{1, \dots, 3n + 1\} \ \;\; (2)$ <br>
          $\sum\limits_{i \in E} \sum\limits_{j=1}^{3n+1} j x_{ij} = 3n+4 \;\; \,\forall E \;\; (3)$ <br>
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>The constraints in this ILP define the feasible puzzle solution space. Specifically, the constraints in (1) make sure that a unique number is assigned to each node in the graph. The constraints in (2) assign a number from 1 to $3n+1$ to each node. While the constraints in (3) guarantee that the sum of values along each edge $E$ in the graph adds up to $3n + 4$.</p>

      <p>As a side note, in this case, we do not care about the objective function of the ILP, here set to maximize a constant! This is because we only care to find a <em>feasible</em> solution to the problem. Note that introducing a set of initial values does not guarantee that a feasible solution will be found. Only a correct set of initial values will render a feasible solution! Also, note that more than one feasible solution exists! Try to find them all, that is, if you dare!</p>
